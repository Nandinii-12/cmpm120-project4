# Personal Rubric Grading (10 pts):
- Assets (1) - We found and used many different assets off of the kenny assets. We mixed and matched in order to design our game. ✅

- Top-down movement (1) - The player uses WASD to move, which is common for top-down RPGs.   We also implemented a sprinting mechanism, and attack using keyboard interaction as outlined above. ✅

- Health System (1) - We implemented a health system in the second half of the game, making the player lose lives if they get attacked by the knights, and having the option of a lose screen. ✅

- Collectibles (2) - Overall, we did have collectible items in the first level (water bucket and coins), each as a mini game giving rewards. Unlike our original plan, we deviated from "collecting" a princess, and decided to make the second level more combat based, since we felt it made the game more well rounded. ✅

- Puzzle solving and interaction (3) - ✅
